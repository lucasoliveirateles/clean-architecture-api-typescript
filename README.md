# **Clean Node API**

![clean](https://github.com/teles1g/clean-ts-api/blob/main/public/img/logo-course.png)

This API is part of the training of professor Rodrigo Manguinho (Mango) at Udemy.

The objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
